Welcome to my GitHub home. I am a senior open source strategy advisor. Based in Geneva, Switzerland, I provide open source, [InnerSource](https://innersourcecommons.org/), blockchain, metaverse, quantum safe security, and other highly innovative technologies strategy consulting and advisory services to my clients. I also operate as a Chief Open Source Officer (if you are wondering why you need such a role in your organization, [here is the answer](https://www.finos.org/blog/this-is-why-your-organization-needs-a-chief-open-source-officer-wipro)) on contract for my clients. This is a continuation of the activity I had previously exercised for 9 years within Wipro but now as an independant consultant.
  
Prior to that, I was Director of Product Management for the Network Security, [Quantum Key Distribution](https://www.idquantique.com/quantum-safe-security/overview/) and [Quantum Random Number Generation](https://www.idquantique.com/random-number-generation/overview/) products, at [ID Quantique](https://www.idquantique.com/), a company leader in high-performance multi-protocol network encryption, based on conventional and quantum technologies, aiming at providing future-proof encryption for time sensitive data.  While there, I founded the [Quantum-safe Security working group](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/quantum-safe-security/) of the Cloud Security Alliance.
  
During my career, I have been involved in both security and open source, in roles such as chief technology strategist for security and open source at Sun Microsystems, advising the largest accounts globally on their IT security or their open source strategy. I moved on to develop global market and business development strategies for open source and security in public sector, still at Sun, and then Oracle. I have been active in lobbying activities, in particular for these companies, around cryptography, DRM, and open standards.  
  
I have worked extensively with venture capitalists as a strategic advisor for their due diligence process on IT start-ups, and am member of the boards (advisory or directors) of 3 startups.  I was, for example, instrumental in helping Swiss VC [Polytech Ventures](https://www.polytechventures.ch/) understand the business value of what was to become their first investment in [SCALA](https://www.scala-lang.org/).
  
I co-founded [Why Open Computing!](https://whyopencomputing.ch/), a Swiss company focusing on selling sustainable laptops that can be user-serviced and community supported for years on.  I was their CTO for the duration of my presence there and responsible for the choices of our operating system ([Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)) and laptop ODM vendor (at the time [CLEVO](https://www.clevo.com.tw/)).

A seasoned traveler, I have, throughout my career, exercised management functions such as recruitment, building and managing a team, and driving multicultural, multinational projects.  
  
Strong communicator with fine negotiation skills. I am at ease taking complex technical subjects and bringing them to a level that makes sense for any audience, from developers to civil servants and CxOs. Evangelist, speaker at key industry events, I am also a press and analyst contact.  
  
I keep a list of [recordings of public sessions](https://tinyurl.com/GillesYT) I've delivered throughout my career.

Joining my passion for [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ggravier/) and for music, I co-founded [La Compagnie Divague](https://www.lacompagniedivague.com/), in April 2013, with a friend soprano singer, [Cl√©mentine Decouture](https://www.clementinedecouture.com/). This non-profit (*loi 1901)* assotiation aims at promoting lyrical singing in all social, economical, cultural contexts. We organize concerts and shows in multiple countries, have published a [CD](https://www.lacompagniedivague.com/okiyolepremierdisquedelaciedivague), and organized themed events (e.g. on Crohn's disease, or agains breast cancer).
